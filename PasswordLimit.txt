 Project Password Management
 a. Create a PROFILE named Password_Management where PASSWORD LIFE TIME will be 10 days, 
PASSWORD GRACE TIME will be 8 days, PASSWORD REUSE MAX will be 3, PASSWORD LOCK TIME will be for 1 day, 
FAILED LOGIN ATTEMPTS for 2 times, PASSWORD REUSE TIME 10 days. Prove each profile by appropriate 
comment execution. Submit the consequent execution comment in text file. Also show the comment for 
 showing your created profile.   							
 b. To prevent a password from being reused, you can use one of two profile parameters: PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX 
  or PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME. ‘These two parameters are mutually exclusive; if you set a value for one of them, 
the other must not be set to UNLIMITED’ - justify the statement.
